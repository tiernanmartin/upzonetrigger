Its purpose is to provide some documentation of the datasets that are not directly
included in the package.

The following external datasets are accessed by workflows in this package:

}
\description{
This is a list of datasets that are included in the package workflow but
are not stored in the \code{data/} directory.

The primary reason that a dataset is included in this list is that it exceeds Github's
50 MB file size limit (see \href{https://help.github.com/articles/conditions-for-large-files/}{here} for details).
