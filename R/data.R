#' @title External Data List
#' @description This is a list of datasets that are included in the package workflow but
#'   are not stored in the \code{data/} directory.
#'
#'   The primary reason that a dataset is included in this list is that it exceeds Github's
#'   50 MB file size limit (see \href{https://help.github.com/articles/conditions-for-large-files/}{here} for details).
#'
#' @docType data
#' @format The data itself is simply a \code{NULL} value.
#'
#'  Its purpose is to provide some documentation of the datasets that are not directly
#'  included in the package.
#'
#'  The following external datasets are accessed by workflows in this package:
